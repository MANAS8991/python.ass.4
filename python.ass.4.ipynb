    "\n",
    "2- Syntax: Tuples are defined using parentheses () or simply commas , without any explicit syntax for denoting a tuple. For example: (1, 2, 3) or 1, 2, 3. Lists, on the other hand, are defined using square brackets []. For example: [1, 2, 3].\n",

They are useful for cases where immutability is desired, such as representing coordinates, database records, or returning multiple values from a function. Lists, being mutable, are used when the collection needs to be modified, expanded, or ordered. They are generally more versatile and commonly used for various data manipulation tasks.\n",

Since lists are mutable, you can modify elements, add new elements with append() or extend(), remove elements with pop() or remove(), sort elements with sort(), and more. Tuples, being immutable, have a limited set of methods available, primarily focused on accessing and manipulating the tuple's elements.\n",
